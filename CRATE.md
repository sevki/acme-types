This crate defines types for implementing ACME ([RFC 8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555)) providers and clients.

- This crate does not include any HTTP library or provide any functionality (beyond support for de/serialization, as documented below) for interacting with an ACME client or provider, e.g. a server or client
- This crate does not provide any of the cryptographic functions necessary for implementing an ACME provider or client

```rust
use acme_types::v2 as ACME;

let resp = reqwest::get("https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await?;

let directory = ACME::Directory::from_str(&resp).unwrap();

println!("{:#?}", directory);

>>> Directory {
>>>     new_nonce: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/new-nonce",
>>>     new_account: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/new-acct",

## Crate Features

### JSON De/serialization (`json`)

Serialization and deserialization to and from JSON is supported using the `serde` (and `serde_json`) crate(s). This integration is optional (feature `json`):

```toml
acme-types = { version = "*", features = ["json"] }
```

When this feature is enabled, `from_str` and `to_string` are implemented on top-level ACME objects and resources.
